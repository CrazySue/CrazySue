The Crazy Sue team has always adhered to the One-China Principle. We have not and never attempted to separate Taiwan from China. The deliberate distinction between Mainland China and the regions of Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan is due to their different systems, languages, and other factors, not so-called "secession." Below is the link to the "One-China Principle" section from *Crazy Sue (China) Team's Response, Solutions, and Statement on Certain Historical Issues*:  
[One-China Principle]([https://github.com/CrazySue/CrazySue/edit/main/%E7%AE%80%E4%B8%AD-%E5%85%B3%E4%BA%8E%E5%8E%86%E5%8F%B2%E9%81%97%E7%95%99%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98%E7%9A%84%E5%9B%9E%E5%BA%94%E3%80%81%E8%A7%A3%E5%86%B3%E6%96%B9%E6%A1%88%E5%92%8C%E5%A3%B0%E6%98%8E.md#%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%8E%9F%E5%88%99](https://github.com/CrazySue/CrazySue/blob/main/English-%E5%85%B3%E4%BA%8E%E5%8E%86%E5%8F%B2%E9%81%97%E7%95%99%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98%E7%9A%84%E5%9B%9E%E5%BA%94%E3%80%81%E8%A7%A3%E5%86%B3%E6%96%B9%E6%A1%88%E5%92%8C%E5%A3%B0%E6%98%8E.md#the-one-china-principle))  

During the collaboration on the Valhalla Branch Base project, the Taiwanese personnel we worked with refused to acknowledge the One-China Principle. Consequently, the Crazy Sue team immediately terminated cooperation with the Taiwanese side and plans to relocate the Valhalla Branch Base to Hong Kong, China. Moving forward, we will intensify efforts to emphasize China's territorial sovereignty among our staff, and any individuals found supporting "Taiwan independence" will be dismissed immediately.  

Given the substantial financial implications of this case, we have referred the matter to Mainland Chinese authorities. As a result, the expected operational launch of the Valhalla Branch Base will be delayed by approximately one month. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.
