关于“Crazy Sue团队微信端自动回复程序”的声明
［This article is also available in English］
​经过一段时间的开发，我们几乎可以确定，我们将在“疯狂的Sue”和“CrazySue”微信账号上部署“Crazy Sue 团队微信端自动回复程序”。该程序关系到每一位用户，故特别向所有用户通知：
​1. 为优化用户体验，我们将在北京时间（GMT+8:00）2月13日启用该程序。如果你继续向我们发送消息，则代表你已阅读本声明。
2. 当你向我们发送消息时，不论你是否撤回，我们都将存储你发送的信息6个月。我们可以保证，在可控范围内，你的个人数据和你发送的信息不会在互联网上或任何你未授权的组内泄露。
3. Crazy Sue 团队已开启“Crazy Sue 客户端”的第一批内测，相信在不久后客户端将代替该程序。
 
After a period of development, we are almost certain that we will deploy the "Crazy Sue Team WeChat Autoresponder" on the "疯狂的Sue" and "CrazySue" WeChat accounts. This procedure concerns every user and is therefore specifically informed to all users:
1. In order to optimize the user experience, we will launch the app on February 13 (GMT+8:00) Beijing time. If you continue to send us messages, you will be deemed to have read this notice.
2. When you send us a message, we will store the message you send for 6 months, regardless of whether you withdraw it or not. We can guarantee that, within our control, your personal data and the information you send will not be leaked on the Internet or within any group that you are not authorised.
3. The Crazy Sue team has started the first batch of closed beta testing of the "Crazy Sue Client", and it is believed that the client will replace the program in the near future.
