## About the title
### Our name to users
An excellent team makes profits; a great team makes people's hearts.

We believe that if a team calls you "you" but the team gets your money through various means and monitors every move you make to "improve the user experience", and even opens the "User Experience Improvement Program" without your consent, then this must not be a great team.

A truly great team maintains normal operations by opening-source projects, reporting bugs, and charging fees that are only 5% higher than the cost.

### What users call us
> [!NOTE]
> If you see any name such as "Crazy Sue International Team" that does not match the "Crazy Sue (China) Team" (which may be referred to as "Crazy Sue" or "Crazy Sue Team" in some occasions, but will definitely use the full name in formal non-technical documents), please do not doubt it, it is not our official account, please contact us as soon as possible and report the account.

You can call us by the following titles:
- Crazy Sue (China) Team
- Crazy Sue Team
- Crazy Sue

## About the official and unofficial communities
### Official Community
We have no intention of creating an official community at this time because we think those unofficial communities (such as the Chinese ice circle) do better than us.
> [!NOTE]
> If you see any so-called official community such as "Crazy Sue Official Community", please do not have to question it. Please contact us as soon as possible and report the community.
### Unofficial Community
The unofficial community has nothing to do with us, it does not belong to us, and we do not have the authority to manage it. The unofficial community is operated by the administrator of that community, so any activity related to us is legally a commercial partnership, not a sponsorship relationship.

## About User Privacy
### The message you send us
Generally speaking, the information you send to us through any channel will be stored for 6 months. Of course, we will ensure the data is secure and unless legal issues are made, we will not use, disclose this information, whether or not they are of value.

### The questions, vulnerabilities or suggestions you have reported to us
The questions, vulnerabilities or suggestions you have reported to us are sent anonymously to our receiving system. We have never asked you to fill in sensitive information. If you have received such questionnaires and other information, please do not question it. It is not our official account. Please contact us as soon as possible and report the account.

### Personal data you submit to us
Please be assured that your personal data will be hashed as irreversible strings and stored in a secure location. We guarantee the security of your personal data (especially privacy data).

## On political issues

### The one-China principle
We have always recognized the one-China principle and have added the word "China" before "Hong Kong", "Macao" and "Taiwan" on all occasions (except in special circumstances).
> [！ Note]
> The references to "Chinese mainland" in the documents, recommendations, methods and other information carriers we publish do not include Hong Kong, Macau, China and Taiwan.

### Political stance
We have no political position and will not favor any political situation, political group or other political forces.

### Other political issues
For political questions posed to us by users or others, unless there are legal issues, we always answer with "I'm sorry, we don't see a valid claim".

## About Partnerships, Sponsorships, and Donations

### Collaboration
We welcome any company, team or organization with whom we are interested in cooperating, regardless of whether it is located in the same country or region, race, religion, belief, local culture, etc.

### Sponsorship
We never accept sponsorship from sponsors, and we hope that sponsors will focus on product optimization and user experience, rather than hyping it up by issuing business orders.
> [！ Note]
> If you see the word "Sponsored" in an ad that appears on our products, you may not be using a genuine product.

### Donate
We only accept small donations from adult users. For minors, we have felt your heart, if you really want to support us, you can share our products with your friends or family members, we are super super thank you! For non-users, we also do not accept your sponsorship, as we want donations from users who have been using our products for a long time and want to show their support to us.

## Other questions
Due to the confusion, we did not organize it systematically. This part will be displayed in QA

> [!NOTE]
> We are still collecting this part of the problem, so we will not display it for the time being. If you have any questions not mentioned above (except political and technical issues), please feedback to your email address crazysue@126.com.
